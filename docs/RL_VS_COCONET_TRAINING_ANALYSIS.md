# ü§ñ RL Model Training Approaches: Current vs. Coconet-Based Training

## üìã **Executive Summary**

The current RL model approach shows **poor harmonization quality** despite extensive training (10,700 episodes). This analysis compares the **current approach** (training on simple melodies with music theory rewards) versus a **proposed Coconet-based training approach** (training the RL model to score and optimize Coconet harmonizations).

## üéØ **Current RL Model Approach**

### **Training Methodology**

- **Training Data**: Simple C major scale melodies (8 notes)
- **Reward Function**: Music theory + contrary motion rewards
- **Training Episodes**: 10,700
- **States Explored**: 168,285
- **Average Reward**: 17.563
- **Best Reward**: 19.4

### **Current Reward Structure**

```python
def calculate_reward(self, melody_note, harmony_note, prev_melody_note=None, prev_harmony_note=None):
    # Base music theory reward (consonance, intervals)
    base_reward = super().calculate_reward(melody_note, harmony_note, prev_melody_note, prev_harmony_note)

    # Contrary motion reward (weight: 2.0)
    contrary_reward = self.calculate_contrary_motion_reward(melody_note, harmony_note, prev_melody_note, prev_harmony_note)

    return base_reward + contrary_reward
```

### **Problems with Current Approach**

#### **1. Limited Training Data**

- **Issue**: Training on simple 8-note C major scale
- **Problem**: Model learns patterns from overly simplistic melodies
- **Impact**: Poor generalization to complex, real-world melodies

#### **2. Synthetic Reward Function**

- **Issue**: Hand-crafted music theory rules
- **Problem**: Rules may not capture real musical quality
- **Impact**: Model optimizes for artificial metrics, not musical appeal

#### **3. No Real-World Feedback**

- **Issue**: No exposure to actual harmonization examples
- **Problem**: Model doesn't learn from successful harmonizations
- **Impact**: Generated harmonies sound mechanical and unmusical

#### **4. Overfitting to Simple Patterns**

- **Issue**: Training on repetitive, predictable patterns
- **Problem**: Model learns to generate similar, boring harmonies
- **Impact**: Lack of musical creativity and variety

## üéº **Proposed Coconet-Based Training Approach**

### **New Training Methodology**

- **Training Data**: Coconet-generated harmonizations of real melodies
- **Reward Function**: Quality scoring of Coconet outputs + optimization
- **Training Episodes**: 10,000+ (on diverse harmonizations)
- **Focus**: Learning to improve existing harmonizations

### **Proposed Reward Structure**

```python
def calculate_coconet_based_reward(self, coconet_harmonization, melody_notes):
    # 1. Score the Coconet harmonization quality
    quality_score = self.evaluate_harmonization_quality(coconet_harmonization, melody_notes)

    # 2. Reward improvements over Coconet baseline
    improvement_reward = self.calculate_improvement_reward(coconet_harmonization, optimized_harmonization)

    # 3. Contrary motion optimization
    contrary_motion_reward = self.calculate_contrary_motion_reward(optimized_harmonization, melody_notes)

    # 4. Melody preservation reward
    melody_preservation_reward = self.calculate_melody_preservation_reward(optimized_harmonization, melody_notes)

    return quality_score + improvement_reward + contrary_motion_reward + melody_preservation_reward
```

### **Advantages of Coconet-Based Training**

#### **1. Real-World Training Data**

- **Benefit**: Training on actual harmonizations of real melodies
- **Impact**: Model learns from successful musical examples
- **Result**: Better generalization to diverse musical styles

#### **2. Quality-Based Learning**

- **Benefit**: Model learns to recognize and improve harmonization quality
- **Impact**: Focus on musical appeal rather than artificial rules
- **Result**: More musically satisfying outputs

#### **3. Incremental Improvement**

- **Benefit**: Model learns to optimize existing harmonizations
- **Impact**: Builds on Coconet's neural creativity
- **Result**: Combines neural network creativity with RL optimization

#### **4. Diverse Musical Exposure**

- **Benefit**: Training on harmonizations of various melodies
- **Impact**: Model learns broader musical patterns
- **Result**: Better adaptation to different musical styles
