# N-Part Harmonization Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed implementation plan for developing an n-part automatic harmonization system using reinforcement learning. The system will wrap the pre-trained Coconet model in an RL environment to generate harmonically coherent multi-part compositions by learning to balance various musical rules through reward-based learning.

## Project Overview

### Objective

Develop an AI system that can automatically generate n-part harmonizations (typically 2-4 parts) from a given melody or chord progression, using Coconet as the base model and reinforcement learning to balance musical theory rules and aesthetic quality.

### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional rule-based harmonization systems, this approach uses reinforcement learning to intelligently blend musical rules through reward signals rather than hard constraints, enabling more natural and musically satisfying outputs. We leverage Coconet's sophisticated harmony generation capabilities while adding tunable music theory rewards.
