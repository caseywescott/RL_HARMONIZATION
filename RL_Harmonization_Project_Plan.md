# N-Part Harmonization with Reinforcement Learning

## Project Objective

This project aims to extend the work from "Tuning Recurrent Networks with Reinforcement Learning" (Magenta, 2016) to create an n-part automatic harmonization model using reinforcement learning. The goal is to develop a system that can generate harmonically coherent multi-part compositions by learning to balance various musical rules through reward-based learning rather than strict rule enforcement.

## Core Innovation

The key insight is that **reinforcement learning allows the model to learn to blend musical rules together in clever ways without being forced to follow all rules simultaneously**. The rules are enforced through reward signals rather than hard constraints, enabling more natural and musically satisfying outputs.

## Technical Approach

### 1. Model Architecture

**Base Model:**

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer-based architecture
- Multi-track output for n-part harmonization
- Each part (voice) generated simultaneously with awareness of other parts

**Architecture Components:**

```
Input: Melody line or chord progression
↓
Encoder: Process input musical features
↓
Decoder: Generate n-part harmonization
↓
RL Agent: Evaluate and reward outputs
↓
Output: Harmonized n-part composition
```

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Framework

**State Space:**

- Current musical context (recent notes, harmonic context)
- Generated notes for each part so far
- Musical features (key, time signature, etc.)

**Action Space:**

- Note selection for each part
- Duration and articulation choices
- Harmonic progression decisions

**Reward Function:**
Based on the metrics from Figure 2 of your paper, the reward function should evaluate:

1. **Harmonic Coherence**

   - Chord quality and progression
   - Voice leading smoothness
   - Harmonic tension and resolution

2. **Counterpoint Rules**

   - Parallel motion avoidance
   - Proper voice spacing
   - Harmonic leaps management

3. **Musical Quality**

   - Melodic interest in each part
   - Rhythmic variety
   - Overall musical flow

4. **Style Consistency**
   - Adherence to target musical style
   - Historical accuracy (if applicable)
   - Genre-specific characteristics

### 3. Training Methodology

**Phase 1: Pre-training**

- Supervised learning on existing harmonization datasets
- Learn basic musical patterns and relationships
- Establish foundation for RL fine-tuning

**Phase 2: RL Fine-tuning**

- Use pre-trained model as starting point
- Apply RL with reward function based on Figure 2 metrics
- Gradually improve rule blending and musical quality

**Phase 3: Style Adaptation**

- Fine-tune for specific musical styles or composers
- Adapt reward weights for different aesthetic preferences
- Generate style-specific harmonizations

### 4. Reward Function Design

The reward function should be a weighted combination of multiple musical metrics:

```python
def calculate_reward(harmonization, target_style):
    reward = 0.0

    # Harmonic coherence (30% weight)
    reward += 0.3 * harmonic_coherence_score(harmonization)

    # Voice leading quality (25% weight)
    reward += 0.25 * voice_leading_score(harmonization)

    # Counterpoint adherence (20% weight)
    reward += 0.2 * counterpoint_score(harmonization)

    # Musical interest (15% weight)
    reward += 0.15 * musical_interest_score(harmonization)

    # Style consistency (10% weight)
    reward += 0.1 * style_consistency_score(harmonization, target_style)

    return reward
```

## Conclusion

This project represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted music composition by combining the strengths of deep learning with the flexibility of reinforcement learning. By using reward-based learning to balance musical rules, the system can generate more natural and musically satisfying n-part harmonizations while maintaining the theoretical foundation established in your paper.

The key innovation lies in the intelligent blending of rules through RL, allowing the model to learn sophisticated musical relationships that would be difficult to encode explicitly. This approach has the potential to revolutionize how we think about AI-assisted composition and could lead to new tools for musicians, composers, and music educators.
